- [NIST Special Publication 800-37, Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf)
  - This publication describes the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and provides guidelines for applying the RMF to information systems and organizations. 
  - The RMF provides a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for managing security and privacy risk that includes information security categorization; 
    - control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring. 
  - The RMF includes activities to prepare organizations to execute the framework at appropriate risk management levels. 
  - The RMF also promotes near real-time risk management and ongoing information system and common control authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring processes; 
    - provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make efficient, cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions and business functions; 
    - and incorporates security and privacy into the system development life cycle. 
  - Executing the RMF tasks links essential risk management processes at the system level to risk management processes at the organization level. 
  - In addition, it establishes responsibility and accountability for the controls implemented within an organization’s information systems and inherited by those systems.
